This project has three parts.

**Part 1 -** In this part, I did data exploration. I tried find some interesting numbers from the dataset, and wrote some queries to demonstrate my SQL skills.

**Part 2 -** This is the visualization part using Tableau. I wrote 4 queries in the end of my part 1 which I used for this vizualization.
